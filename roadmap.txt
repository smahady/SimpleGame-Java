Goals:

- implement Scene class (100% done)
- implement Sprite class (100% done)
	- implement drawing functions (100% done)
	- implement collision functions (100% done)
	- implement motion functions (100% done)
- implement sound class (looping music done)
- implement virtual joystick (100%))
- implement keyboard array (100% done)
- block class made (100%)






Components:
	Kitty.java - Title Screen
	Demo.java - demonstration
	Scene.java - Inherits awt.Canvas, and implements functions needed to define the scene
	Sprite.java - Sprite class that has the simpleGame functions
	Sound.java - implements the functions for simpleGame.js's sound functions - written by 
	Joystick.java - implements Virtual Joystick
	Keyboard functions (in Scene.java)
	
New Components:
	Level.java (inherits Scene) - a Scene that tracks movement in relation to its boundaries
	Background.java - Special sprite that can be assigned movement based on Level's position
	Block.java - Sprite whose position is based on worldPos, with collision mechanisms to prevent MovingSprite from crossing
	TiledBackground.java - accepts an array of sprites
	//MovingSprite - Sprite who cannot cross blocks - nevermind no sprites can cross blocks

12/5/17 - BIG CHANGE! The Joystick doesn't really need to be added above the Demo level. Since the programmer shouldbe 
programming at the level of Demo.java, which inherits scene, I've modified it so that it can be implemented at that level. 
This way other mouse functions might work later.

Also, I added my last game so that everything is testable. I also made a background class, and a "block" class. Offssets now work,
and I ebelieve the solution was more elegant than Tyler's code.
